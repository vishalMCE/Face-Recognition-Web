                UniFI is web-app based facial recognition tool.
                It has been built to be used for checking the details and its authenticity of any person in an organisation.
                It
                can be used by invigilators in examination halls to check if the person appearing in the exam is the same
                that
                they claim. Details of the students can be changed by administration of the organisation.

                Checking the authenticity of a person in an organisation is of utmost importance. While the current process
                of
                checking through identity cards is working fine the process itself is not feasible if the organisation body
                is
                very large. The solution to this problem is "UniFI: A Facial Recognition Tool" which not only helps with
                checking
                authenticity of the person. This only requires the database of all the people in the organisation which they
                already have.

                Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face. It
                captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details. We have used Python and its
                framework Flask for the backend. To setup the facial recognition features of the app we have used libraries
                such
                as OpenCV, Facial-Recognition.
